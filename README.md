# Project Title: Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Health Behaviors

## Techniques Used:
- Cross-sectional study design
- Descriptive statistics
- Data collection via online questionnaires
- Independent t-tests
- Chi-square analyses
- SPSS Statistics software

## Summary:
I assessed the current and expected food consumption, physical activity, and alcohol use of first-semester students during (N = 208) and after (N = 171) COVID-19 restrictions. Data was collected online in the initial weeks of the semester. Using SPSS, I analyzed baseline differences with independent t-tests and chi-square tests, comparing health behaviors between the cohorts using independent t-tests. Results showed significant changes in health behaviors, indicating the need for tailored strategies to promote healthy behaviors during restrictive circumstances.
